        </ul>

        <h2>4. Resource Limits</h2>
        <p>
          Yeti Fabric operates on a fair-use model. All customers share underlying infrastructure,
          and we expect responsible resource consumption:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Fair use</strong> — Resource usage should be consistent with normal application
            workloads. Sustained consumption that significantly exceeds your plan's intended capacity
            may be throttled or require a plan upgrade.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No cryptocurrency mining</strong> — Compute resources may not be used for mining,
            hashing, or any blockchain proof-of-work operations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No excessive storage abuse</strong> — The platform is designed for application
            data. Using storage for bulk file hosting, media archives, backups of external systems,
            or other purposes unrelated to your Yeti applications is not permitted.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Enforcement</h2>
        <p>
          We enforce this policy progressively, taking into account the severity and intent of the
          violation:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Warning</strong> — For first-time or minor violations, we will notify you and
            request that you correct the issue within a reasonable timeframe.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Suspension</strong> — For repeated or serious violations, we may temporarily
            suspend your access to the platform while the issue is investigated and resolved.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Termination</strong> — For severe violations, willful misconduct, or failure to
            remedy a violation after warning, we may permanently terminate your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No refund for violations</strong> — If your account is terminated due to a
            violation of this policy, you are not entitled to a refund of any prepaid fees.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to take immediate action without prior notice when a violation poses
          an imminent threat to the security, integrity, or availability of the platform.
        </p>
