        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          We are committed to helping you succeed with the Yeti platform. Support availability,
          response times, and channels depend on your subscription tier. All paid plans include
          access to our support team via email, with higher tiers receiving faster response times
          and dedicated support resources.
        </p>

          Response times are measured from the time we receive your support request during the
          applicable availability window. Response times represent initial acknowledgment, not
          resolution time.

        <h2>3. Severity Levels</h2>
        <p>
          When submitting a support request, please indicate the severity level. We may reclassify

        <h2>5. Uptime SLA</h2>
        <p>
          For customers on paid plans (Pro and Enterprise), Yeti commits to a monthly uptime target
          of <strong>99.9%</strong> for the Yeti Fabric platform, measured as the percentage of total
          minutes in a calendar month during which the platform is available.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Measurement</strong> — Uptime is calculated monthly based on server-side
            availability monitoring. Scheduled maintenance windows, announced at least 48 hours in
            advance, are excluded from uptime calculations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Service credits</strong> — If we fail to meet the 99.9% uptime target in a given
            month, affected customers may request a service credit equal to 10% of that month's fees
            for each full 0.1% below the target, up to a maximum of 30% of that month's fees.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Requesting credits</strong> — To receive a service credit, you must submit a
            request to <a href="mailto:support@yetirocks.com">support@yetirocks.com</a> within 30
            days of the end of the affected month, including the dates and times of the downtime
            experienced.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The uptime SLA does not apply to Free tier accounts, beta features, or issues caused by
          factors outside of Yeti's reasonable control (including force majeure events, customer
          network issues, or third-party service failures).
