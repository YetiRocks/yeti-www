          uses cookies and similar technologies on our website and
          platform. This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are, how we use them, and how you can
          manage your preferences.
        </p>

        <h2>1. What Are Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit a website. They help the
          site remember your preferences, keep you signed in, and understand how you interact with
          the content. Cookies may be "session" cookies (deleted when you close your browser) or
          "persistent" cookies (stored until they expire or you delete them).
        </p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Cookies</h2>
        <p>We use the following categories of cookies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Essential cookies</strong> — Required for the platform to function. These handle
            authentication, session management, and security protections such as CSRF tokens. You
            cannot opt out of essential cookies without losing access to core functionality.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytics cookies</strong> — Help us understand how visitors use our website, which
            pages are most popular, and where users encounter issues. Analytics data is aggregated and
            does not identify you personally.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Preference cookies</strong> — Remember your settings and choices, such as language,
            region, theme, and display preferences, so you don't have to reconfigure them on each visit.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          We use a limited number of third-party services that may set their own cookies on your device:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Google Analytics 4</strong> — Collects anonymized usage data including pages visited,
            session duration, and approximate geographic location. Google's privacy policy is available
            at{' '}

            </a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cloudflare</strong> — Provides content delivery, DDoS protection, and DNS services.
            Cloudflare may set cookies to distinguish between human visitors and automated traffic.
            Cloudflare's privacy policy is available at{' '}

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not use any advertising cookies, remarketing pixels, or third-party tracking for
          ad targeting purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Managing Cookies</h2>

          </li>

          Please note that disabling essential cookies will prevent you from signing in and using
          authenticated features of the platform.
        </p>
