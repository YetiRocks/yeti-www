            Most teams start with SQLite, rewrite to Postgres, bolt on Redis, add Kafka, then hire two people to run Kubernetes. That's six months gone before you ship anything real. Yeti skips the whole cycle. Your prototype and your production deployment run on the same compiled Rust runtime and the same embedded storage. No rewrites. No migration weekends. Same codebase from week one through year three.

                Your local dev environment runs the same compiled Rust and RocksDB storage as production. Sub-millisecond p95 latency on day one. No "it was fast in dev" surprises when you ship.

                A GraphQL schema defines your data model. A YAML config declares auth, permissions, and extensions. That's it. No framework boilerplate, no ORM, no migration scripts. Need custom logic? Write it in Rust and it hot-reloads on save.

          <p className="section-desc">
            Yeti's SDK gives you high-level abstractions that look like JavaScript but compile to native Rust. No lifetimes, no borrow checker fights. If you can write Express, you can write Yeti. Connect Claude, Cursor, or Copilot through the built-in MCP server and let your AI agent build entire applications while you focus on the product.

              <div className="feature-text">
                Every Yeti instance ships with an MCP server that understands the platform deeply. Agents introspect schemas, query live data, and generate correct code on the first try. Not just an API to hit - a system that agents can reason about.

                A single Yeti node handles traffic that would need a fleet of Node.js servers. Not because you tuned anything, but because everything compiles to native Rust with RocksDB storage and parallel query execution.

                Authentication, telemetry, vector search, MQTT - they're not plugins you install or services you connect. They ship with Yeti and run in-process. Add <code>auth: true</code> to your config. That's your auth service. No separate deployment, no separate failure mode.

          <p className="section-desc">
            A typical stack needs separate processes for the API server, database, cache, message broker, and background workers. Yeti is a single binary that handles all of it. One process to deploy, monitor, and scale. Your infrastructure bill drops by an order of magnitude.

                Rust's efficiency means one Yeti instance replaces a cluster of application servers. Fewer moving parts means fewer things that break. When something does go wrong, there's one process to investigate, not seven.
