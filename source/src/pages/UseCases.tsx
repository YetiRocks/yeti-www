        <p className="section-desc">
          Content platforms need to verify licenses, enforce geo-restrictions, and log access events at scale. A typical setup involves an API gateway, an auth service, a rules engine, a message broker for audit trails, and a monitoring stack to watch it all. That's five services before you serve a single asset. Yeti collapses all of it into one binary with single-digit-millisecond response times.

              JWT validation, role-based access control, and per-field permissions run in-process. No network hop to a separate auth service. Token verification happens in microseconds, not milliseconds. Add OAuth and RBAC rules in config - no auth code to write or maintain.

              Every access decision, every content view, every policy change fires a PubSub event. Subscribe via SSE for live dashboards or MQTT for downstream processing. No separate message broker. The event stream is a built-in feature of every table.

          Ad decisioning happens in under 100ms end-to-end. The backend processing your bid requests, matching ad inventory, and streaming results to exchanges can't be the bottleneck. Traditional stacks layer an API server, a search index, a cache, and a message broker - each one adding latency and failure modes. Yeti handles the full pipeline in a single process.
